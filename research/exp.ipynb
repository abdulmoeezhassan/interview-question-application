Theory \\n \\n \\n2.1 Introduction \\n \\nWe live in the information age. In the same way that the development of industry created the \\nindustrial age, the development of information technology systems, and especially the internet, has \\ncreated the information age. It has been a long-held belief by many philosophers that knowledge \\nis power and that knowledge stems from understanding of information; information, in turn, is the \\nassigning of meaning to data.  To develop learners' understanding of information technology, we \\nstart by defining these three related concepts. The topics are hierarchical in that: \\n \\n \\n \\n2.2 Data \\n \\n2.2.1 What is data? \\n \\nThe concept of data as it is used in the syllabus is commonly referred to as ‘raw’ data – a collection \\nof text, numbers and symbols with no meaning. Data therefore has to be processed, or provided \\nwith a context, before it can have meaning. \\n \\nExample \\n• 3, 6, 9, 12 \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 \\nThese are meaningless sets of data. They could be the first four answers in the 3 x table, \\na list of household pets and the heights of 15-year-old students but without a context we \\ndon’t know. \\n \\nData \\nbecomes \\nInformation \\nbecomes \\nKnowledge \\n4 Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledgeTheory \\n2.3 Information \\n \\n2.3.1 What is information? \\n \\nIt is important that students learn the concept of what ‘information’ is as used in information \\ntechnology. Information is the result of processing data, usually by computer. This results in facts, \\nwhich enables the processed data to be used in context and have meaning. Information is data \\nthat has meaning. \\n \\n2.3.2 When does data become information? \\n \\nData on its own has no meaning.  It only takes on meaning and becomes information when it is \\ninterpreted. Data consists of raw facts and figures. When that data is processed into sets according \\nto context, it provides information.  \\n \\nData refers to raw input that when processed or arranged makes meaningful output. Information is \\nusually the processed outcome of data. When data is processed into information, it becomes \\ninterpretable and gains significance. \\n \\nIn IT, symbols, characters, images, or numbers are data. These are the inputs an IT system needs \\nto process in order to produce a meaningful interpretation. In other words, data in a meaningful \\nform becomes information. Information can be about facts, things, concepts, or anything relevant to \\nthe topic concerned.  It may provide answers to questions like who, which, when, why, what, and \\nhow. \\n \\nIf we put Information into an equation it would look like this: \\n \\nData + Meaning = Information \\n \\nExample \\nLooking at the examples given for data: \\n• 3, 6, 9, 12 \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 \\nOnly when we assign a context or meaning does the data become information. It all \\nbecomes meaningful when we are told: \\n• 3, 6, 9 and 12 are the first four answers in the 3 x table \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo is a list of household pets \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 are the heights of 15-year-old students. \\n \\n2.4 Knowledge \\n \\n2.4.1 What is knowledge? \\n \\nWhen someone memorises information this is often referred to as ‘rote-learning’ or ‘learning by \\nheart’. We can then say that they have acquired some knowledge. Another form of knowledge is \\nproduced as a result of understanding information that has been given to us, and using that \\ninformation to gain knowledge of how to solve problems. \\n Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledge 5Theory \\n \\nKnowledge can therefore be: \\n• acquiring and remembering a set of facts, or \\n• the use of information to solve problems. \\n \\nThe first type is often called explicit knowledge. This is knowledge that can be easily passed on to \\nothers. Most forms of explicit knowledge can be stored in certain media. The information contained \\nin encyclopedias and textbooks are good examples of explicit knowledge. \\n \\nThe second type is called tacit knowledge. It is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to pass on to \\nanother person just by writing it down. For example, saying that Paris is the capital of France is \\nexplicit knowledge that can be written down, passed on, and understood by someone else. \\nHowever, the ability to speak a foreign language, bake bread, program a computer or use \\ncomplicated machinery requires additional pieces of knowledge (such as that gained through \\nexperience) that are not always known explicitly and are difficult to pass on to other users. \\n \\n2.4.2 How are data, information and knowledge linked? \\n \\nIf we put Knowledge into an equation it would look like this: \\n \\nInformation + application or use = Knowledge \\n \\nExample \\nLooking at the examples given for data: \\n• 3, 6, 9, 12 \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 \\nOnly when we assign a context or meaning does the data become information. It all becomes \\nmeaningful when we are told: \\n• 3, 6, 9 and 12 are the first four answers in the 3 x table \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo is a list of household pets \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 are the heights of the five tallest 15-year-old students in a \\nclass. \\nIf we now apply this information to gain further knowledge we could say that:  \\n• 4, 8, 12 and 16 are the first four answers in the 4 x table (because the 3 x table starts at \\nthree and goes up in threes the 4 x table must start at four and go up in fours) \\n• The tallest student is 175.3cm. \\n• A lion is not a household pet as it is not in the list and it lives in the wild. \\n \\n6 Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledgeExam preparation \\n \\n3. Exam preparation \\n \\n \\nThe topic of Data, information and knowledge requires learners to define and understand the \\nmeaning of these terms, as well as to be able to demonstrate how the topic is hierarchical (i.e. how \\ndata becomes information and how information becomes knowledge). Learners must know and \\nunderstand these things in order to be able to answer any exam questions which may come up on \\nthis topic. \\n \\n Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledge 7Further resources \\n \\n4.

Class and homework activities \\n \\n \\n5.1 During teaching  \\n \\nThe following activities are suggested during the teaching of this topic. \\n \\n5.1.1 Data \\n \\n1) Start by asking learners to brainstorm the meaning of ‘data’, asking for definitions. An effective \\nway of getting ideas is to tell learners that they are not allowed to comment on other learners’ ideas \\nthroughout the activity of brainstorming.  \\n \\n2) Ask learners to search for ‘data’ on the web and find definitions and examples. Make it clear that \\nthey will need to be careful and investigate only those sites that give IT/computing definitions. You \\ncould then bring the group together to discuss their findings and collectively come up with a \\ndefinition and examples you are happy with. \\n  \\n5.1.2 Information \\n \\n1) Start by asking learners to brainstorm ‘information’, asking for definitions. Then ask them to \\nsearch for ‘information’ on the internet to find definitions and examples. Make it clear that they will \\nneed to be careful and find only those sites that give IT/computing definitions. You could limit them \\nto the three sites given in Section 4.  \\n \\nBring the group together to discuss their findings and then collectively come up with a definition \\nand examples you are happy with. \\n \\n2) Explain the following to your learners as a way of demonstrating how context and meaning are \\nintegral parts of what is considered information: \\n \\nThe data item 01111101 could be the binary equivalent of the integer 125 or it could be binary for \\nthe ASCII code for the symbol  ‘}’ . How this number is processed determines how it is displayed, \\nbut as well as this there has to be a context.  \\n \\nIf we know that 01111101 is the way the computer stores the re-order quantity in a stock file then \\nwe know it represents the integer 125. However, if we are told that it is part of a stored word-\\nprocessed document then we can be confident that it represents the symbol  ‘}’. \\n \\n  \\n Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledge 95.1.3 Knowledge \\n \\nAfter repeating the type of activity that the learners undertook for data and information, give them \\nthis example: \\n \\n \\nData: The number 40 000 is a piece of data, as is the name Iqbal Ahmed. Without anything else to \\nhelp us, these two items of data are meaningless. \\n \\nInformation: If we now say that ‘Iqbal Ahmed is a teacher’ and ‘$40 000 is a teacher’s salary’, the \\ndata is given meaning or context, and makes more sense to us. \\n \\nKnowledge: builds on the information. Knowledge is ‘Iqbal Ahmed is a teacher and he earns  \\n$40 000 per year’. \\n \\n \\nThen ask learners to come up with their own examples. \\n \\n \\n5.2 Topic consolidation \\n \\nThe following activities are suggested to consolidate your students’ learning after they have studied \\nthis topic: \\n \\n5.2.1 Sixty second challenge – sum up knowledge learned in this topic \\n \\nGive learners an A4 piece of paper and ask them to write down everything they can remember \\nabout the topic Data, Information and knowledge in 60 seconds. No outside resources such as \\ntextbooks, their lesson notes or computers are allowed. \\n \\nLearners then work in groups of four to compare their ideas, and using a side of A3 paper, copy \\nout the relevant points for displaying in the classroom. \\n \\n5.2.2 Write the new words you have learnt in this topic and what they mean in terms of \\ninformation technology \\n \\nAgain each learner should have a piece of A4 paper to write on, but this activity is not limited by an \\namount of time. You may need to bring the activity to an end when the majority of the learners \\nhave completed the activity. \\n \\nYou could collect and collate these responses and display the better ones on a wall of the \\nclassroom to be used by learners as a visual stimulus when revising. \\n \\n5.2.3 Self-assessment – record what you’ve learnt, any difficulties you have had and set \\nyour personal targets for learning. \\n \\nThis activity is not time limited but you will need to be aware of when your learners have started to \\nrun out of ideas. \\n \\nLearners will need to set their own targets for learning and together with you, will need to devise \\nmethods by which they can achieve their targets. \\n \\n5.2.4 Change of role – student as teacher. What questions would you ask the class and \\nwhy?Class and homework activities \\nAsk learners to imagine they are the teacher. They write down three questions they would ask the \\nother learners that would fully show that they have understood the topic. \\n \\nOne learner then uses their questions to ask the other learners about the topic. After learners have \\nanswered the questions, ask the group to comment on whether the questions were detailed \\nenough. Give them a few minutes to refine their own questions.   \\n \\nOther learners in turn take the role of the teacher, allowing time to refine questions each time a \\nlearner finishes asking questions. \\n \\nNote: The number of learners allowed to ask questions needs to be small unless the group is \\nsmall. \\n \\n5.2.5 Consolidation using question and answer cards \\n \\nThis activity is only suitable for medium to large teaching groups (at least eight learners). \\nCreate cards (and laminate them if possible) with a question on one card and the answer on \\nanother.  Mix the cards up, and give each learner two cards – an answer card and a question card, \\nso that learners don’t have a matching question and answer. Ask the learners to stand up. \\n \\nSelect a learner to start by asking their question (read from the card). The learner with the correct \\nanswer shows their answer card. They then ask their question from their question card and sit \\ndown. The activity continues until there are no learners left standing.   \\n \\n \\n5.3 End of topic test \\n \\n1. Explain the difference between data and information. [2 marks] \\n2. Describe how data becomes knowledge. [3 marks] \\n3. 5, 10, 15, 20 are items of data. Explain how these could become information and what \\nknowledge could be gained from them.

The information contained \\nin encyclopedias and textbooks are good examples of explicit knowledge. \\n \\nThe second type is called tacit knowledge. It is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to pass on to \\nanother person just by writing it down. For example, saying that Paris is the capital of France is \\nexplicit knowledge that can be written down, passed on, and understood by someone else. \\nHowever, the ability to speak a foreign language, bake bread, program a computer or use \\ncomplicated machinery requires additional pieces of knowledge (such as that gained through \\nexperience) that are not always known explicitly and are difficult to pass on to other users. \\n \\n2.4.2 How are data, information and knowledge linked? \\n \\nIf we put Knowledge into an equation it would look like this: \\n \\nInformation + application or use = Knowledge \\n \\nExample \\nLooking at the examples given for data: \\n• 3, 6, 9, 12 \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 \\nOnly when we assign a context or meaning does the data become information.

What questions would you ask the class and \\nwhy?Class and homework activities \\nAsk learners to imagine they are the teacher. They write down three questions they would ask the \\nother learners that would fully show that they have understood the topic. \\n \\nOne learner then uses their questions to ask the other learners about the topic. After learners have \\nanswered the questions, ask the group to comment on whether the questions were detailed \\nenough. Give them a few minutes to refine their own questions.   \\n \\nOther learners in turn take the role of the teacher, allowing time to refine questions each time a \\nlearner finishes asking questions. \\n \\nNote: The number of learners allowed to ask questions needs to be small unless the group is \\nsmall. \\n \\n5.2.5 Consolidation using question and answer cards \\n \\nThis activity is only suitable for medium to large teaching groups (at least eight learners). \\nCreate cards (and laminate them if possible) with a question on one card and the answer on \\nanother.  Mix the cards up, and give each learner two cards – an answer card and a question card, \\nso that learners don’t have a matching question and answer. Ask the learners to stand up. \\n \\nSelect a learner to start by asking their question (read from the card). The learner with the correct \\nanswer shows their answer card. They then ask their question from their question card and sit \\ndown. The activity continues until there are no learners left standing.   \\n \\n \\n5.3 End of topic test \\n \\n1.

This topic defines \\nsome of the fundamental concepts used in topic 1 Data, information, knowledge and processing, \\nas well as in the syllabus as a whole    \\n \\nSection 1 lists some key terms used in this topic and their definitions. Section 2 Theory provides \\nthe basic theory that you will need for teaching this topic, including illustrative examples. Section 3 \\nindicates what your learners need to know, understand, or be able to do for this topic in the \\nexamination. Section 4 lists some useful websites relevant to the topic for you or your learners to \\nuse. Section 5 provides activities for you to carry out with your learners to teach this topic, to \\nconsolidate, and to check learning.  \\n \\nLearning objectives \\n \\nReading this guide should help you guide learners to cope with the following syllabus learning \\nobjectives: \\n \\n• define data, clearly identifying that data has no meaning \\n• define information and show how data can become information through context and meaning \\n• define knowledge and understand that information becomes knowledge when human \\nexperience is applied. \\n \\nPrior knowledge \\n \\nBefore you begin teaching this topic: \\n• If you look for information about data, information and knowledge make sure you \\nonly look at computing or information technology (IT) resources – many \\nresearchers in a variety of fields such as sociology, economics and science use \\nthe terms data and information to mean the same thing. \\n• The term ‘data’ as used in the syllabus is often referred to in other fields as ‘raw \\ndata’. Make sure you are aware of this before you research the topic. \\n \\n2 Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledgeKey terms \\n \\n1.

Theory \\n \\n \\n2.1 Introduction \\n \\nWe live in the information age. In the same way that the development of industry created the \\nindustrial age, the development of information technology systems, and especially the internet, has \\ncreated the information age. It has been a long-held belief by many philosophers that knowledge \\nis power and that knowledge stems from understanding of information; information, in turn, is the \\nassigning of meaning to data.  To develop learners' understanding of information technology, we \\nstart by defining these three related concepts. The topics are hierarchical in that: \\n \\n \\n \\n2.2 Data \\n \\n2.2.1 What is data? \\n \\nThe concept of data as it is used in the syllabus is commonly referred to as ‘raw’ data – a collection \\nof text, numbers and symbols with no meaning. Data therefore has to be processed, or provided \\nwith a context, before it can have meaning. \\n \\nExample \\n• 3, 6, 9, 12 \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 \\nThese are meaningless sets of data. They could be the first four answers in the 3 x table, \\na list of household pets and the heights of 15-year-old students but without a context we \\ndon’t know. \\n \\nData \\nbecomes \\nInformation \\nbecomes \\nKnowledge \\n4 Topic support guide 9626 Topic 1.1 Data, information and knowledgeTheory \\n2.3 Information \\n \\n2.3.1 What is information? \\n \\nIt is important that students learn the concept of what ‘information’ is as used in information \\ntechnology. Information is the result of processing data, usually by computer. This results in facts, \\nwhich enables the processed data to be used in context and have meaning. Information is data \\nthat has meaning. \\n \\n2.3.2 When does data become information? \\n \\nData on its own has no meaning.  It only takes on meaning and becomes information when it is \\ninterpreted. Data consists of raw facts and figures. When that data is processed into sets according \\nto context, it provides information.  \\n \\nData refers to raw input that when processed or arranged makes meaningful output. Information is \\nusually the processed outcome of data. When data is processed into information, it becomes \\ninterpretable and gains significance. \\n \\nIn IT, symbols, characters, images, or numbers are data. These are the inputs an IT system needs \\nto process in order to produce a meaningful interpretation. In other words, data in a meaningful \\nform becomes information. Information can be about facts, things, concepts, or anything relevant to \\nthe topic concerned.  It may provide answers to questions like who, which, when, why, what, and \\nhow. \\n \\nIf we put Information into an equation it would look like this: \\n \\nData + Meaning = Information \\n \\nExample \\nLooking at the examples given for data: \\n• 3, 6, 9, 12 \\n• cat, dog, gerbil, rabbit, cockatoo \\n• 161.2, 175.3, 166.4, 164.7, 169.3 \\nOnly when we assign a context or meaning does the data become information.

We can then say that they have acquired some knowledge.

Mix the cards up, and give each learner two cards – an answer card and a question card, \\nso that learners don’t have a matching question and answer. Ask the learners to stand up. \\n \\nSelect a learner to start by asking their question (read from the card). The learner with the correct \\nanswer shows their answer card. They then ask their question from their question card and sit \\ndown. The activity continues until there are no learners left standing.   \\n \\n \\n5.3 End of topic test \\n \\n1.
